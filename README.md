This repository, named Pickled-Fish-Cc, consists of 3 folders and 4 files and is a public database.  
The folder named data is used to store experimental data and serves as an input folder. It helps with data analysis and currently contains the file OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv  
The folder named output is used as an output folder to store files after you have completed processing and corrections, where the purpose of the folder named data is to store and track your cleaned up data frames after you have completed all data processing and corrections. The folder named figures is used to store images after processing and corrections have been made.  
The folder named pics stores the pictures used to draw each fish on the graph, to help make the pictures better for understanding.  
The gitignore file is created in the R studio to control what is tracked and ignored in Git. Here we have added the path to the graphics folder to this folder.  
Pickled-Fish-Cc#pickled-fish-cc.Rproj file is our own R project created for the purpose of reusing and sharing, for easy management, organisation and documentation, to keep input and output files related to this project/topic together for ease of finding, and to transfer/backup/share the folder as a whole.  
The git_fishes_student.Rmd file is an r markdown format file that can be used to easily explore and analyse data, it organically combines the R code with the documentation and our data processing is all done in this file.  
README.md describes the main information about the project and is a primer for the project, describing the use of the project, its functions and making it easier for others to understand and use.
